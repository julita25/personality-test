  1: `You feel that living alone is to live happily, and you prefer hiding in a crowd rather than standing out in one.
  You are perpetually tormented by the idea of doing things wrong, not understanding or not being alert enough or intelligent
  enough to do what others expect of you. You lack in self-confidence and you seem to believe that others are better than you. 
  While in a conversation, for example, you would be more likely to go along with the other's points of view as you don't fully 
  respect your own opinions. Where there's a low level task to complete or a service to be allotted, it's you who volunteers. 
  When people want to get out of a task, they naturally come to you as they know that you never say 'no'.`,
  2: `In public and at work you are a ball of energy perpetually on the move. You take the initiative, encourage others,
  hate waiting and are endlessly anticipating what's going on around you. You take real pleasure in managing everything, 
  much like the conductor of an orchestra. You enjoy being noticed by your work peers and your anxiety is linked more to 
  the thought of leaving others indifferent. You need other's attention to fully exist, but once you've crossed the threshold
  of your home, it's another matter. You no longer take initiatives, but leave others to decide in your place. When your partner 
  asks you to make a choice or give an opinion about holiday destinations, dinner menus or the children's activities, you offer 
  little or no input. You're not comfortable and don't know how to react and those around you often interpret your passiveness 
  as a lack of interest or a certain reticence.`
